# Meow

* Meow is a simple programming language based of Monkey, a language build by Thorsten Ball for the purpose of building an interpreter in Go. I followed his book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)to be Meow up and running, and learn about interpreters and compilers in the process. Enjoy!
